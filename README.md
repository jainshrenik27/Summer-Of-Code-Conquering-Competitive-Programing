# ðŸ“˜ Competitive Programming Journey â€“ Midterm Submission

**ðŸ‘¤ About Me**  
Hi! Iâ€™m **Shrenik Jain**, a first-year undergraduate student at **IIT Bombay**. This repository is part of my contribution to the **Summer of Code** program, where Iâ€™ve been actively developing my skills in Competitive Programming. Iâ€™m excited to document and share my journey, learnings, and implementations here.

**ðŸš€ Project Overview**  
This repository tracks my progress in Competitive Programming. It includes my weekly goals, the concepts Iâ€™ve covered, and the problems Iâ€™ve tackled. I update it regularly with code, notes, and reflections as I dive deeper into algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

**ðŸ“ˆ Progress So Far**

**ðŸ”¹ Week 1**
- Revised essential **C++ concepts**
- Explored **Backtracking** and its applications
- Learned about **Time and Space Complexity**
- Implemented **Binary Search**

**ðŸ”¹ Week 2**
- Practiced using **C++ STL**:
  - **Stack**, **Queue**, **Deque**
  - **Set** and **Map**
  - **Unordered Map**
- Implemented six sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
  - **Heap Sort**
- Learned the basics of **Bit Manipulation**

**ðŸ”¹ Week 3**
- Studied **Graph Theory** fundamentals
- Implemented:
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- *(To be updated with more practice problems)*

**ðŸ”¹ Week 4**
- Dedicated the week to **revision**
- Revisited previous concepts and cleared **backlogs**

**ðŸ”¹ Week 5**
- Learned about **Spanning Trees** and **Shortest Path Algorithms**
- Implemented:
  - **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
  - **Primâ€™s Algorithm**
  - **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**
  - **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**

**ðŸ“… Future Plans**
Iâ€™ll continue updating this repository with advanced algorithms, problem sets, and code from platforms like **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, and **AtCoder**. My goal is to build a strong foundation for future contests and interviews. Stay tuned for more updates!
